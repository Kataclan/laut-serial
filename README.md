# Laut Serial App

Control access app developed for a music club, to keep score of members access through the reading of NFC cards, verifying against a database of said members.

I have used React Native to be able to use the device NFC reader through the react-native-nfc-manager library to be able to read the members' cards. The card codes are stored in a firebase database, along with other metadata that is displayed in certain views of the app, and that will later serve as insights for possible promotions.
